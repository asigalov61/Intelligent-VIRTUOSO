# Intelligent-VIRTUOSO
## "Music never allows falsehoods for even the deaf hear flat notes!" ---IV

***

### A successful Artificial Intelligence child of the [Meddleying VIRTUOSO](https://github.com/asigalov61/Meddleying-VIRTUOSO) and the [Chordified GTP2 Piano](https://github.com/asigalov61/Amazing-GPT2-Piano).

***

### Plays very well and produces very nice music compositions with the right tuning/dataset.

### Enjoy!

### UPDATE 03-20-2021: Please see [Optimus-VIRTUOSO](https://github.com/asigalov61/Optimus-VIRTUOSO) repo for a more streamlined and much more capable implementation of Intelligent-VIRTUOSO/GPT2 Music AI system.
